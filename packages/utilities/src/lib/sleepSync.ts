 * That, and that synchronous means that nothing else in the thread will run for the length of the timer.
 *
 * For an asynchronous variant, see [sleep](./sleep.d.ts).
 * @param ms The number of milliseconds to sleep.
 * @param value A value to return.
 * @see {@link sleep} for an asynchronous version.
